# An Introduction to Functional Programming

This presentation provides an introduction to functional programming. It aims to develop intuition behind the big ideas of functional programming and includes several examples in Haskell. Since the best way to learn is by doing, there are also some exercises to help you start thinking like a functional programmer.

If you would like to learn more about functional programming, I highly recommend UPenn's CIS 194 class (linked below). I have also included a number of additional links that you may find interesting.
